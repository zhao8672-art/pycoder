432 plugins, 2,769 skills, 297 agents, 30 community contributors — validated and ready to install.

## Why this repo

- **One canonical catalog** — every plugin in `marketplace.extended.json` is the same `marketplace.json` the Claude Code CLI reads. No registries to reconcile, no manual sync step.
- **Spec-correct or it doesn't ship** — every PR runs the [Intent Solutions validator](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/tree/main/scripts) against the [AgentSkills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard plus Claude Code's [skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and [plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) references. C-grade rejects merge.
- **8-field marketplace frontmatter is enforced**, not aspirational — `name / description / allowed-tools / version / author / license / compatibility / tags`. The [100-point rubric](https://tonsofskills.com/grading) is public.
- **Forge-generated and hand-authored, both first-class** — `/skill-creator --forge <api-name>` builds production-grade plugins from any REST API with an audit trail; hand-authored plugins use the same templates and validators.
- **Production-tested patterns** — the [Learning Lab](#learning-lab), [11 production playbooks](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/wiki/Playbook-Index), and a [public wiki](#project-wiki) cover the failure modes that show up at scale (rate limits, MCP reliability, multi-agent cost caps, incident debugging).

```bash
pnpm add -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi    # Install the CLI
ccpi install devops-automation-pack     # Install any plugin
```

Or use Claude's built-in command:

> **Killer Skill of the Week** — [tonone](https://github.com/tonone-ai/tonone) by [tonone-ai](https://github.com/tonone-ai)
>
> **A 23-agent engineering and product team that ships from one session — two commands, zero meetings**
>
> tonone turns Claude Code into a full delivery team: 23 specialist agents (architect, reviewers, product, QA and the rest of the org chart) coordinated through 125 skills, so one session runs discovery, build, review, and ship without you playing project manager between tools. The mirror featured here is the curated cut — every one of its 114 agent definitions verifies clean at the kernel-strict frontmatter floor in the latest inventory run, preserved by the marketplace's never-clobber freeze. MIT-licensed and actively developed upstream; a frontmatter sweep for the skill tier is offered upstream and the roster works as-is today.

## How Agent Skills Work

Agent Skills are instruction files (`SKILL.md`) that teach Claude Code **when** and **how** to perform specific tasks. Unlike commands that require explicit `/slash` triggers, skills activate automatically when Claude detects relevant conversation context.

### The Activation Flow

```
1. INSTALL     /plugin install ansible-playbook-creator@claude-code-plugins-plus
2. STARTUP     Claude reads SKILL.md frontmatter → learns trigger phrases
3. ACTIVATE    You say "create an ansible playbook for Apache"
4. EXECUTE     Claude matches trigger → reads full skill → follows instructions
```

### What a Skill Looks Like

```yaml
---
name: ansible-playbook-creator
description: |
  Generate production-ready Ansible playbooks. Use when automating server
  configuration or deployments. Trigger with "ansible playbook" or
  "create playbook for [task]".

## Instructions
1. Gather target host details and desired state
2. Select appropriate Ansible modules
3. Generate playbook with proper variable templating
4. Validate syntax with `ansible-lint`

## Output
- Complete playbook YAML ready for `ansible-playbook` execution
```

## Resources

### Built on the Anthropic stack

This catalog targets Claude Code as its only first-class harness. Every reference page in the SKILL.md spec, plugin structure, MCP integration, hooks, and subagents work in this repo is grounded in the deep references below — not the top-level docs.

**Claude Code documentation**

## FAQ

**What is this?** A Claude Code plugin marketplace: 432 plugins, 2,769 skills, 297 agents, all validated against the [AgentSkills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard and the [Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) / [plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) references.

**How do I install a plugin?** Use the CLI (`ccpi install <name>`) or Claude Code's built-in `/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins` followed by `/plugin install <name>@claude-code-plugins-plus`. The [Quick Start](#quick-start) covers both paths.

**Plugin vs skill — what's the difference?** A plugin is the distribution unit (folder with `plugin.json` + components); a skill is one component type inside a plugin (a `SKILL.md` file). One plugin can ship many skills, commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. The [Plugin Structure wiki page](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/wiki/Plugin-Structure) is the deeper explanation.

**Where do I browse the catalog?** [tonsofskills.com](https://tonsofskills.com) is the search-and-browse surface. The [`plugins/`](./plugins/) directory is the source of truth on GitHub.

**Where do I get support?** Open an [issue](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/issues) for bugs, a [discussion](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/discussions) for ideas, or email **jeremy@intentsolutions.io**. For the underlying CLI itself, see [Anthropic's Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/) first.

## Troubleshooting

Common install + author paths:

- **Plugin install fails or doesn't activate** — see the [Troubleshooting wiki page](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/wiki/Troubleshooting) for the common "missing required field" / "frontmatter wrong shape" / "marketplace not reachable" cases.
- **Marketplace add fails** — verify slug with `/plugin marketplace list`; the public slug is `jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins` (GitHub 301-redirects to the canonical `-plus-skills` repo).
- **MCP server doesn't connect** — the [MCP-Server-Plugins wiki page](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/wiki/MCP-Server-Plugins) covers transport selection and the most common transport-mismatch errors. Anthropic's [MCP integration reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) is the upstream source.
- **Validator says my skill is C-grade** — see [Validation and Grading](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/wiki/Validation-and-Grading) for the 100-point breakdown and the public [/grading rubric page](https://tonsofskills.com/grading) for worked examples.
- **Compatibility field deprecation** — `compatible-with` was deprecated in schema 3.4.0. Migrate with `python3 scripts/batch-remediate.py --migrate-compatible-with`.
