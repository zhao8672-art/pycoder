## What is this

`claude-red` is a curated library of offensive security skills for the [Claude Skills system](https://docs.claude.com). Each skill is a structured `SKILL.md` file that primes Claude with expert-level methodology for a specific attack surface — from SQLi to shellcode, EDR evasion to ADCS abuse.

Drop a skill into your Claude environment and it behaves like a specialist: it knows the techniques, the tooling, the edge cases, and the escalation paths. Skills load on demand based on conversational triggers — you don't pay context for skills you aren't using.

**Use it for:** authorized red team engagements, bug bounty triage, security research, CTF preparation, training operators, and exploring attack surfaces methodically.

---

## Quickstart

### Claude Skills System (recommended)

```bash
# Clone into a directory Claude will scan
git clone https://github.com/SnailSploit/claude-red ~/.claude/skills/claude-red

# Or install only one category
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/SnailSploit/claude-red
cd claude-red && git sparse-checkout set Skills/web Skills/active-directory
```

Claude will auto-load matching skills based on conversational triggers (e.g. mentioning SQLi loads `offensive-sqli`).

### Claude Code

```bash
# Point Claude at a single skill before a session
cat Skills/web/offensive-sqli/SKILL.md | claude --system-file -

# Or load a whole category
cat Skills/active-directory/**/SKILL.md | claude --system-file -
```

### Claude.ai (Manual)

Paste the contents of a `SKILL.md` into a Project's system prompt or prepend to your conversation.

### Install Script

```bash
./install.sh                           # interactive
./install.sh --target ~/.claude/skills # explicit target
./install.sh --category web            # one category
```
